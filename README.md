# J.Dan_Portfolio
Welcome!

I'm Jesús Daniel Pérez García, and this here is my work on my first designer's portfolio on the web.
It involves mere HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a simple yet solid structure involving basic information about my persona and work.

You can visualize it in the following link:
